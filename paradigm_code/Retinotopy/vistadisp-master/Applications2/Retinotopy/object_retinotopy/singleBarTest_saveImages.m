% script singleBarTest_saveImages:
%
% Saves face bar images for the single-bar-position test.
% 
% This experiment is designed to test predictions from our scaled-faces pRF
% mapping experiment. The objective is to place a single bar aperture at a
% fixed location of the visual field, and have different sizes of faces
% behind the aperture. If the pRF results hold, we would predict that
% larger face images will produce a wider spatial extent of responses in 
% ventral cortex, extending into regions (like the ipsilateral cortical 
% hemisphere) which under other conditions would not represent the retinal
% position of the bar aperture. For instance, if the single bar is
% distinctly in the left visual field, we would not expect strong responses
% in left ventral cortex, since the contralateral visual field is never
% stimulated. But if the pRFs in these regions reflect the perceived extent
% of the object, then we may see some response to large faces, which are
% perceived as behind an aperture, but extending into the right visual
% field.
