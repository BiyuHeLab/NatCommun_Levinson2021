% OS X: ___________________________________________________________________
%
% Unlike on OS 9 and Windows, On OS X setting a high priority will not
% disable important parts of your computer such as the keybaord and hard
% drive. Priority calls the Psychtoolbox mex function MachSetPriority.  For
% simple, OS-neutral control of process priority on OS X use Priority. For
% complicated, fine-grained, OS-specific control of process priority use
% MachSetPriority.    
%
% At priority settings greater than 0, your script must limit MATLAB's  use
% of CPU time to stay within the limits specified by the priority value.
% The consequence of failing to restrict the CPU time to the limits
% specified by the priority values is that OS X will demote MATLAB back to
% priority 0.  You can check to see if this has happened by calling
% Priority with no arguments.
%
% Within a script there are two ways to limit MATLAB's use of CPU time:
%
%   1. Call "WaitSecs" 
%   2. Call Screen('Flip',...)
% 
% Both calls will sleep the main MATLAB thread, surrendering CPU time to
% other threads on the system until the MATLAB thread is awakened.
% WaitSecs sleeps the MATLAB thread for a specified period.
% Screen('Flip',...) sleeps the MATLAB thread until the next video blanking
% interval.
%
% The priority value corresponds to the proportion of the video frame
% period  during which MATLAB is guranteed 100 percent of CPU time:
%
%   GuaranteedCPUtimePerFramePeriod = priority/10 * framePeriod
%
% If your computer has multiple video displays running at different frame
% rates then Priority will choose the shortest frame period.
%
% The consequence of a thread exceeding the specified limits on CPU usage
% are that the MACH kernel will revoke its real-time priority status.
% However, the threshold at which the MACH kernel decices to revoke
% priority is not known.  We have observed that at 100% CPU usage the
% Jaguar Mach kernel will revoke priority after 2.5 seconds, indepent of
% the CPU time requested when setting priority.  
%
% Note that if you change the video frame rate after setting priority then
% the framePeriod which Priority used when setting the priority level will
% no longer match the true frame period. Therefore you should change the
% priority level after changing the video mode and not before. 
%
% MacOS-X version before 10.4.7: __________________________________________
%
% Because the OS X update process causes setjmp calls within MATLAB to
% delay for up to about 13ms, Priority kills the system update process when
% setting any priority greater than 0.  Priority will restart the update
% proceess when setting priority back to 0, but only if it was Priority
% itself which killed the update process.  If update was already killed
% when Priority was set to a level greater than 0 then priority will not
% restart the update process when restoring priority to 0. You can use
% KillUpdateProcess and StartUpdateProcess to kill and restart the update
% process  without using Prioirity.  Because killing and starting the
% update process sometimes requires that an adminstrator password be
% entered in the MATLAB command window,  you might prefer not kill and
% restart  with every call to Priority, but instead to do this only at the
% beginning and end of a MATLAB session by using KillUpdateProcess and
% StartUpdateProcess.
%
% MacOS-X version 10.4.7 and later: _______________________________________
%
% Due to improvements in the realtime behaviour of OS-X 10.4.7 and later,
% it is no longer neccessary to kill the update process. If Priority()
% detects such an OS version, it will not kill update anymore. This
% provides an over hundred-fold speedup in the execution of Priority(). If
% you think that timing gets worse on your system, you can check the timing
% by running the test command 'TestMATLABTimingOSX'. If you rather want
% Priority to kill the update process on 10.4.7 and later, please create a
% file with the name 'AlwaysKillUpdate' in the Psychtoolbox root folder to
% enforce killing of the update process. The content of the file does not
% matter at all.
%
%
% WINDOWS: ________________________________________________________________
% 
% For the Windows version of Priority (and Rush), the priority levels set
% are  "process priority levels". There are 3 priority levels available,
% levels 0, 1, and 2. Level 0 is "normal priority level", level 1 is "high
% priority level", and level 2 is "real time priority level". Combined with
% thread priority levels, they determine the absolute priority level of the
% matlab  thread. Threads are executed in a "round robin" fashion on
% Windows, with the  lower priority threads getting cpu time slice only
% when no higher priority thread  is ready to execute. Currently, no tests
% had been done to see what tasks are pre-empted by setting the Matlab
% process to real-time priority. It does seem to block keyboard input,
% though, so for example if you have a clut animation going on at priority
% level 2, then the force-quit key combo (Ctrl-Alt-Delete) does not  work.
% However, the keyboard inputs are still sent to the message queue, so
% GetChar or GetClicks still work if they are also called at priority level
% 2.
% 
% LINUX: __________________________________________________________________
%
% GNU/Linux supports priority levels between 0 and 99. Zero means standard
% non-realtime timesharing operation -- Play fair with all other
% applications. Increasing values greater than zero mean realtime mode: The
% Matlab/Octave process is scheduled in round robin realtime mode with a
% priority corresponding to the given number - higher means better, but
% also more likelihood of interfering with system processes. Try to stick
% to a level of 1 unless you know what you're doing!
%
% In realtime mode, PTB will also try to lock down all of Matlab/Octaves
% memory into physical RAM, preventing it from being paged out to disk by
% the virtual memory manager. If it works, it's great! However, the amount
% of lockable memory is restricted to max. 50% of installed RAM memory on
% a standard Linux setup, so if Matlab/Octave/your experiment would need
% more than 50% of available system memory, this will fail. PTB will output
% an informative warning in this case, but continue otherwise unaffected.
% Realtime scheduling will be still effective, you'll just lose the bonus
% of memory locking.
%
% Be careful not to create any uninterruptible infinite loops in your code
% when running realtime, otherwise your system may lock up, reqiring a
% hard reboot!
