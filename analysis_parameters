# FSL anatomical analysis parameters
f=0.5 #fractional intensity threshold for 'bet' skull-stripping. Smaller value: larger brain estimate
g=0.18 #vertical gradient threshold. Larger value: more brain at bottom, less at top
s=0.2 #smoothing for PD image
min_pd=1 #remove voxels with lower intensity from PD image, to prevent large voxel values in t1/pd image
pd_mask_threshold=100 #exclude voxels with lower intensity when creating mask of PD brain
