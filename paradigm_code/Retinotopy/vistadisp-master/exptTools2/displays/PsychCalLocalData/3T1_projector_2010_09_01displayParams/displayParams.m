The image was projected onto the screen of the the%       posthead coil, which sat on the scanner bed at a 45 deg angle%       (pointing toward the door). The PR650 stood on a tripod just%       outside the scanner room. Because the screen was angled and the%       spectrophotometer was far away, absolute units should not be%       trusted, but relative units should be ok (we believe).%%       800x600 60Hz, for both Apple's panel and projector (mirror mode). %%% KNK:  One of the data points at low luminance levels was artifactual and %       lead to non-monotonic gamma tables...% %       So, what we did was to hack the raw measurements and then%       re-compute certain things that get automatically computed in the%       calibration routine (CalibrateMonSpd).% %       Here's what we did:% % %         First, load original calibration file.% %         then do the following:%               cal = cals{1};%               cal.rawdata.mon(1:101,1) = cal.rawdata.mon(101+(1:101),1);%               cal = CalibrateFitLinMod(cal);%               cal = CalibrateFitGamma(cal, 2^cal.describe.dacsize);%               SaveCalFile(cal,'3T1_projector_2010_09_01');% %      - Kendrick% Critical parametersparams.numPixels = [800 600];params.dimensions = [16 12];params.distance = 24;params.frameRate = 60;params.cmapDepth = 8; %10; % SOD: 10->8params.screenNumber = 1;% Descriptive parametersparams.computerName = 'kendrick?';params.monitor = 'projector';params.position = '3T scanner front';
