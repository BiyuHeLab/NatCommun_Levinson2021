One of the data points at low luminance levels was artifactual and lead to non-monotonic gamma tables...

So, what we did was to hack the raw measurements and then re-compute certain things that get automatically
computed in the calibration routine (CalibrateMonSpd).

Here's what we did:

% first, load original calibration file.
% then do the following:
cal = cals{1};
cal.rawdata.mon(1:101,1) = cal.rawdata.mon(101+(1:101),1);
cal = CalibrateFitLinMod(cal);
cal = CalibrateFitGamma(cal, 2^cal.describe.dacsize);
SaveCalFile(cal,'3T1_projector_2010_09_01');
